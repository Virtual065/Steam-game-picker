## Not so important Readme
Simple Python script that finds the games on 2 accounts, then sorts them into a single list of games shared between both accounts, then if you would like it can randomly pick one of those games (So no more "Pick a game" "No you")




## ðŸ†˜ **Help** ðŸ†˜

If you are unable to get the list of games it is probably to do with the privacy settings with atleast one of the steam accounts. it could also be due to steam being down, you can check that [here](https://steamstat.us/)




## **Disclaimer**

Anyone can use any of this code for you own projects, just give a shoutout to this repo ðŸ™‚
